# birdsdb

`birdsdb` is a database written in Clojure, which allows you to store and query objects. Instead of maintaining a single mutuable instance of the provided data, changes get stored as additional records seperated by timestamps so that every state of an object is reproducable and redoable.

While information gets stored persistently in the file system, a running instance of `birdsdb` is working with a selected copy of the database state in memory to improve performance.

Besides that `birdsdb` is build to be scalable. Multiple instances of a database can be run simultaneously on the same data basis while all of those instances keep their state in sync.

`birdsdb` can be accessed by a TCP connection, prompted directly in console, can be integrated in your own Clojure project, or at a later stage also be accessed by several clients.

A complete list of the features can is listed below.
